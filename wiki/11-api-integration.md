# API Integration Guide

This page documents how to connect mock logic to real APIs in RoadRulez.

---

## 1. Replace Mock Logic
- Update components using mock submission (e.g., FeedbackForm) to call real API endpoints.
- Use `fetch` or `axios` for HTTP requests.

## 2. Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback.
- Show loading and success states.

## 3. API Routes
- Use Next.js API routes in `app/api/` for backend logic.
- Document endpoint structure and expected payloads.

## 4. Testing
- Test API integration with real and mock data.
- Use tools like Postman or built-in tests.
